command injection:

PHP has a command called system: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.system

system ( string $command , int &$result_code = null ) : string|false

A lot of times this is used in a webapp to do things like this

system( "cat file | grep " . $input, null)

In this situation, the intent is being able to feed something into a form and using that string to
grep through a file.  However if you feed

;ls -al

as input to the script, system is really just passing this input along to the shell.  bash will happily run the ls command and php
will give you the output.

defense against command injection, at least in this case:
php has an escapeshellarg() or escapeshellcmd() function to filter the user input to disable attacks like this.
